# How to create a 'Shared Calendar' using the default iPhone Calendar app

<SchedulerAddress locale='en' />

<br />
<br />
<br />

(1) Open the default iPhone calendar app, and tap on 'Calendars' at the bottom center.

<br />
<br />

(2) Tap on 'Add Calendar' at the bottom left, then select 'Add Calendar' from
the menu that appears.

<br />
<br />

(3) Set the 'Account' to 'iCloud', enter a 'Calendar Name' and choose a 'COLOR' for the
calendar, then tap 'Done' at the top right. It's important to set the 'Account'
to 'iCloud'! 📌

<br />
<br />

(4) Tap the 'i' button next to the newly created calendar entry to enter the
'Edit Calendar' screen.

<br />
<br />

(5) Press 'Add Person' on the sharing recipients screen to find and add the
person you wish to share with. Please make sure that the person you want to
share with has an 'email address' in their contacts in order to share the
calendar! 📌

> Can't see the 'Add Person' option? Please go to [iPhone Settings > Account > iCloud > Apps Using iCloud > Show All] and make sure that 'iCloud Calendar' is enabled('On') 🙏

<br />
<br />

(6) Once the recipient accepts the calendar share invitation, the shared
calendar setup is complete! 🙌

<br />
<br />

(7) After completing the sharing setup, you can also utilize the shared calendar
in <NewTabSchedulerApp locale='en' /> app by linking it, allowing you to
access the shared calendar in <NewTabSchedulerApp locale='en' /> app 😎

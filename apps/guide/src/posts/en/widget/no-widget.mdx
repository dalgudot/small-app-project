Just **restart your iPhone**. After restarting, the widgets should be searchable as usual ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Root Cause of Widget Search Failure

<br />

According to the <NewTab href='https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/creating-a-widget-extension/'>Official Apple Devloper Documentation</NewTab>, it's explained as follows:

<br />

> For an appâ€™s widget to appear in the widget gallery, a person must launch the app that contains the widget at least once after the app is installed.

Based on insights from various user feedback for the <NewTabSchedulerApp locale='en' /> app, there might be other causes as well, but restarting the iPhone resolves the issue in all cases of widget search failure ðŸ™Œ
